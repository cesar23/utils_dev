# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":sql_order"
    form: |
      SELECT * FROM table_orders AS t where t.data.orderId='[[name]]' order by t.created_at DESC

  - trigger: ":otro"
    replace: "salida"


  - trigger: ":sql_2order"
    replace: "SELECT * FROM table_orders AS t where t.data.orderId='{{form1.name}}' order by t.created_at DESC "
    vars:
      - name: "form1"
        type: form
        params:
          layout: "Ingresar orderId [[name]]?"
